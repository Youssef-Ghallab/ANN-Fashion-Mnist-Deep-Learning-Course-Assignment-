# Fashion MNIST Image Classification

This project involves training a neural network model to classify images from the Fashion MNIST dataset using deep learning techniques. The goal is to build a model capable of accurately predicting the category of fashion items, such as clothing and accessories, based on their grayscale images.

## Objective

The primary objective of this project is to develop a deep learning model that can classify images of various fashion items into one of ten categories. The categories include t-shirts, trousers, pullovers, dresses, coats, sandals, shirts, sneakers, bags, and ankle boots. The project aims to achieve a high accuracy in classification by training and fine-tuning a neural network using the Fashion MNIST dataset.

## Description of the Fashion MNIST Dataset

The Fashion MNIST dataset is a collection of 70,000 grayscale images of fashion items, each with a resolution of 28x28 pixels. The dataset is divided into:
- **60,000 training images** used for training the model.
- **10,000 test images** used to evaluate the model's performance.

Each image belongs to one of the following ten categories:

| Label | Description        |
|-------|--------------------|
| 0     | T-shirt/top        |
| 1     | Trouser             |
| 2     | Pullover            |
| 3     | Dress               |
| 4     | Coat                |
| 5     | Sandal              |
| 6     | Shirt               |
| 7     | Sneaker             |
| 8     | Bag                 |
| 9     | Ankle boot          |

The dataset serves as a drop-in replacement for the classic MNIST dataset of handwritten digits, but with a focus on fashion items to provide a more challenging classification task.

## Instructions for Running the Code

To run the project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone or download the repository** containing the Notebook.
2. **Install the required dependencies** (see below).

## Expected Results and Model Performance

The neural network is expected to achieve an accuracy of around 85-90% on the test set. The model architecture and hyperparameters may need to be fine-tuned to improve performance. Below are some of the key steps and results expected:

- **Data Preprocessing:** The dataset is normalized by scaling pixel values to the range [0, 1].
- **Model Architecture:** A simple feedforward neural network with multiple hidden layers is used.
- **Training Process:** The model is trained using the Adam optimizer with a categorical cross-entropy loss function.
- **Evaluation:** The model's performance is evaluated using accuracy metrics on the test dataset.
